# CS-4280-Projects
These projects are of different phases of building a compiler that can take in written code of a certain BNF rule and output a .asm file. 
Project 0 is to create a binary tree. 
Project 1 is a scanner that takes in a line of written code and using a driver table see if the tokens are valid or not. 
Project 2 is a Parser that builds a parse tree using the scanner to get new tokens. Uses a certain BNF rule to build parse tree.
Project 3 is a static semantic checker to check if a identifier or variable has been declared or not 
Project 4 is the final compiler that takes in written code and translate that into assembly lanuage. It outputs a .asm file
